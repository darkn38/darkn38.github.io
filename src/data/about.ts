I am a driven IT student with a strong foundation in web development, specializing in React, Java, and MySQL. I enjoy building clean, functional applications and designing efficient database structures. I also have experience with basic data visualizations using Jupyter Notebook and hands-on familiarity with troubleshooting and IT support.

I have deployed projects using Vercel and Render, and I actively use GitHub for version control and project management. I’m continuously improving my skills and working toward becoming a well-rounded developer.
